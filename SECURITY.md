# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
The Omega SDK follows a "Sovereign Stability" model. Only the current release is supported for active environmental rectification.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a vulnerability or a "Dissonance Leak" in the 16-bit Invariant, please do not open a public issue. 

To report a Coherence Breach or Invariant Vulnerability, please use the [Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/aquachroma/Omega_SDK/security/advisories/new) feature on this repository. This ensures the report remains encrypted and out of the public strata until rectified.

We value deterministic integrity and will coordinate a rectified patch as soon as the guardband is verified.
